#### Networking:

- Strong networking skills demonstrated through active volunteering in events from different societies in our college.
- Have built strong networks through LinkedIn.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- I would love to collaborate with like-minded people and work with them.
- I would love to develop as well as showcase my skills through this opportunity.
- Being a top 100 member will definitely boost my career.

#### Career Plan:

- In the immediate term, I plan to work on projects that will technically enhance mine as well as other colleges and make the lives of students easier.
- In the long term, I plan on working as a web developer or in the cybersecurity field, both of which I'm currently exploring.
- I also plan to have a startup to make products that will make the lives of students easier.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- The initiatives of KSUM present huge opportunities for students to improve their creative thinking skills and put forward ideas for a better future.
- Before conducting hackathons or competitions, there needs to be proper awareness classes about these events in offline mode. Many students refrain from joining any events due to the lack of skills.
- They need to be encouraged to develop skills and need to be aware of the fact that skills can be developed from scratch even if they are halfway through college.
